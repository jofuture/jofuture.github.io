WHERE ID = 1661;
```

# Japanese Cities' Attributes

```
SELECT *
FROM CITY
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'JPN';
```

The **STATION** table is described as follows:

<img src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bfn78Y/btrjEqto0zH/HQtDRZnYhVAY4qjDh7A9D0/img.jpg">

```
SELECT CITY,STATE
FROM STATION;
```

# Weather Observation Station 3

Query a list of **CITY** names from **STATION** for cities that have an even **ID** number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.

```
SELECT DISTINCT CITY # 중복제거
FROM STATION
WHERE MOD(ID,2) = 0;
```

# Weather Observation Station 4

Find the difference between the total number of **CITY** entries in the table and the number of distinct **CITY** entries in the table.where **LAT\_N** is the northern latitude and **LONG\_W** is the western longitude.

For example, if there are three records in the table with **CITY** values 'New York', 'New York', 'Bengalaru', there are 2 different city names: 'New York' and 'Bengalaru'. The query returns , because

```
SELECT COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT CITY)
FROM STATION;
```

# Weather Observation Station 5

Query the two cities in **STATION** with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

where **LAT\_N** is the northern latitude and **LONG\_W** is the western longitude.

**Sample Input**

For example, **CITY** has four entries: **DEF, ABC, PQRS** and **WXY**.

LENGTH() 함수를 통해 길이를 구하고, CITY의 길이로 각 오름차순과 내림차순을 한 다음에, CITY의 알파벳 순서로 오름차순을 하고 1개만 출력한다.

```
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1;


SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

# Weather Observation Station 6

where LAT\_N is the northern latitude and LONG\_W is the western longitude.

```
SELECT CITY
FROM STATION S
WHERE S.CITY REGEXP '^[aeiou]';
```

# Weather Observation Station 7

Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from **STATION**. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

```
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE city REGEXP '[aeiou]$';
```

# Weather Observation Station 8

-   결과에 중복 항목이 포함될 수 없음

```
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE city REGEXP '[aeiou]$' and city REGEXP '^[aeiou]';
```

# Weather Observation Station 9

Query the list of CITY names from **STATION** that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

```
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE city REGEXP '^[^aeiou]';
# [^aeiou]를 보면 대괄호 안에 ^가 들어가 있는데 이건 aeiou를 제외하고 라는 의미
```

# Weather Observation Station 10
